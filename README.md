## Description
MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING THE TYPE OF TRIANGLE FROM IT'S DIMMENSIONS.
* The main program calls the function "triangleTracker" when the "TRACK THE TRIANGLES" button is pressed.
* The function first creates a new array named "triangle" with a maximum of three elements.
* The program then creates a variable named "dimmensions".
* The program the gets user input via a prompt saving the input to the variable dimmensions.
* The program saves the value of the variable "dimmensions" to the array "triangle"
* The program repeats the previous action via for loop three times thus filling the array triangle.
* The program then converts the user input into floats using the parseFloat method.
* The program then uses if else statements to determine the type of traingle.
