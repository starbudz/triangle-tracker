## Description

MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING THE TYPE OF TRIANGLE FROM IT'S DIMMENSIONS.

-   The main program calls the function "triangleTracker" when the "TRACK THE TRIANGLES" button is pressed.
-   The function first creates a new array named "triangle" with a maximum of three elements.
-   The program then creates a variable named "dimmensions".
-   The program then gets user input via a prompt saving the input to the variable dimmensions.
-   The program saves the value of the variable "dimmensions" to the array "triangle"
-   The program repeats the previous action via for loop three times thus filling the array triangle.
-   The program then converts the user input into floats using the parseFloat method.
-   The program then uses if else statements to determine the type of traingle.
    ## The main program outputs
-   Equilateral: All sides are equal.
-   Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
-   Scalene: No sides are equal.
-   NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
